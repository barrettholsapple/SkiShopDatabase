**Project Overview:**

This project is a web-based rental management system designed to model and improve customer and equipment rental workflows for a ski and snowboard shop. The goal was to replace fragmented, paper-based tracking with a structured, searchable database and a simple employee-facing interface.

The system focuses on organizing customer records, rental history, and equipment inventory in a way that improves accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility for staff.


**Motivation:**

While working at a local ski shop, I noticed that customer and rental information was primarily stored in paper files and disconnected systems, making it difficult to retrieve records quickly or identify trends. This project was created to explore how a relational database and lightweight web interface could streamline rental operations and reduce data-entry errors.


**Technologies Used:**

PHP – server-side logic

MySQL – relational database design and queries

HTML/CSS – front-end structure and styling

SQL – data querying and manipulation



**Database Design:**

Designed a relational schema to store:

  Customer information

  Equipment inventory

  Rental transactions

Implemented primary and foreign keys to maintain data integrity

Structured tables to support efficient querying and future scalability


**Application Features:**

Add, view, and manage customer records

Track ski and snowboard rentals and returns

Search and retrieve rental history

Employee-facing interface focused on usability and error reduction

Data stored in a centralized MySQL database for consistency


**What I Learned:**

How to translate real-world business processes into a relational database model

Practical experience designing and querying SQL databases

Integrating PHP with MySQL for dynamic data-driven applications

Thinking about usability and data accuracy from an employee’s perspective

The importance of clean data organization for operational decision-making


**Future Improvements:**

Role-based access for employees

Improved search and filtering functionality

Analytics dashboards to summarize rental trends

Migration from local deployment to a hosted environment

📎 Notes

This project is a personal, ongoing build inspired by real operational challenges. It is not currently deployed in a production environment but serves as a foundation for further development and experimentation.
